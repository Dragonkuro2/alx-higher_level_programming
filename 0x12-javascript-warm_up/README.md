## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the significance of JavaScript programming
- Execute JavaScript scripts
- Define variables and constants and differentiate between var, const, and let
- Identify and utilize various data types in JavaScript
- Employ control structures like if, if ... else statements
- Apply comments, loops (while and for), break, and continue statements effectively
- Implement functions and comprehend their return values
- Understand variable scope
- Utilize arithmetic operators and manipulate dictionaries
- Import files in JavaScript

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 14.x)
- Files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
- Mandatory presence of a README.md file at the root of the project folder
