# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

## Description

0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures" is a project focused on exploring the intricacies of JavaScript, particularly emphasizing objects, scopes, and closures. Authored by Guillaume, this project serves as a platform to delve deeper into the foundational aspects of JavaScript programming.

## Overview

This project aims to enhance participants' understanding of JavaScript programming by delving into core concepts such as objects, scopes, and closures. Through hands-on exploration and learning, participants will gain valuable insights into the versatility and power of JavaScript.

## Authored

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to:

- Articulate the significance of JavaScript programming
- Create objects in JavaScript and understand their properties and methods
- Explain the concept of `this` in JavaScript and how it relates to scope
- Define and handle `undefined` in JavaScript
- Understand the importance of variable type and scope in JavaScript programming
- Define closures and demonstrate their practical use cases
- Understand prototypes and inheritance in JavaScript and how to implement them
