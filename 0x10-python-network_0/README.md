#  Python - Network #0: Explore the Fundamentals! 

## What You'll Learn 

This project is your gateway to understanding the building blocks of the web: networking and HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). 

- **Master the URL:** Deconstruct the components like a pro (scheme, domain, subdomain, port, query string). 
- **Unravel HTTP Requests and Responses:** Become a web conversation whisperer. ↔️
- **Decode HTTP Headers:** Understand the hidden messages exchanged between your browser and servers. 
- **Demystify HTTP Cookies:** Learn how websites remember you (without being creepy!). 
- **And more!** 

## Resources 

Expand your knowledge with these helpful resources:

- **[HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/webprogramming/HTTP_Basics.html)** (except TRACE, CONNECT, Language Negotiation, Options MultiView, and Character Set Negotiation)
- **[HTTP Cookies.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/cookies)**

## Let's Get Coding! ⌨️

Embark on your learning journey by meeting the following requirements:

**General:**

- **Approved Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Essential README:** Include this file (`README.md`) in your project's root directory.
- **Testing Environment:** All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. 

**Bash Scripting:**

- **Concise and Focused:** Keep your Bash scripts to exactly 3 lines (excluding blank lines, use `wc -l file` to check). 
- **Executable and Named:** Make your scripts executable and ensure they have the `.sh` extension. 
- **Clear Purpose:** Start each script with `#!/bin/bash` followed by a comment explaining its function. 
- **Silent cURL:** Use `curl -s` for your cURL commands to avoid unnecessary output. 

**Python Scripting:**

- **Executable and Python 3:** Start your Python scripts with `#!/usr/bin/python3` and ensure they use Python 3 (version 3.8.5). 
- **PEP 8 Adherence:** Follow PEP 8 style guidelines using `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) for consistent and readable code. ✨
- **Meaningful Documentation:** Document your modules, classes, and functions using clear and concise docstrings (length will be checked). 

**Remember:**

- All your files should end with a new line. 
- A documentation is not just a word, it's a sentence explaining the purpose! 

**Additional Notes:**

Feel free to explore beyond these resources and engage actively in learning. The world of web development awaits! 

**Good luck and happy coding!**
